# React Bits Pro Integration

You are integrating components and blocks from **React Bits Pro**, a premium shadcn-compatible component registry with 88+ animated components and 158+ page section blocks for React/Next.js applications.

## Souqna project override

When using this skill inside the Souqna repo, recolor React Bits examples to the
homepage system before shipping: black `#0A0A0A`, charcoal `#2A2A2A`, cream
`#E8DCC4`, quiet border `#D1C7B2`, pale text `#F7F7F3`, and white `#FFFFFF`.
Use Exo 2 for English, Thmanyah Serif Display Bold for Arabic headlines, and
monochrome SVG logos. Blue, purple, neon, and orange sample palettes in this
catalog are examples only, not Souqna defaults.

## Installing this skill via CLI

If the user's project already has a `components.json` with the `@reactbits-starter` registry configured, you can install this skill file directly:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @reactbits-starter/skill
```

This places a `SKILL.md` file in the project root. You can then read it for future reference without fetching it again.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when:
- The user wants to add React Bits Pro components or blocks to their project
- The user asks for animated UI components (shaders, particles, 3D effects, cursor effects, text animations)
- The user wants pre-built landing page sections (hero, pricing, features, navigation, footer, etc.)
- The user mentions "react bits", "reactbits", "@reactbits-starter", or "@reactbits-pro"
- The user wants to build a landing page quickly with premium animated blocks
- The user needs WebGL, GSAP, Three.js, or Framer Motion animated components but doesn't want to build them from scratch

## Architecture overview

React Bits Pro uses the **shadcn registry protocol** to distribute components. There are two authenticated registries:

| Registry | Content | Required tier | Install prefix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@reactbits-starter` | 88 animated UI components | Starter, Pro, or Ultimate | `@reactbits-starter/` |
| `@reactbits-pro` | 158+ page section blocks | Pro or Ultimate | `@reactbits-pro/` |

Components are installed directly into the user's codebase (not as npm packages). They become local source files the user owns and can modify.

### Component variants

Every **component** (from `@reactbits-starter`) has TWO variants:
- **`-tw`** (Tailwind) — uses Tailwind CSS utility classes via `cn()` helper. **Preferred for Tailwind projects.**
- **`-css`** (CSS) — uses a co-located `.css` file with vanilla CSS. Use when the project does not use Tailwind.

Every **block** (from `@reactbits-pro`) has only ONE version — Tailwind-based, no suffix needed.

### File installation paths

When installed, files land at:
- Components: `components/react-bits/{component-name}.tsx` (and `.css` for CSS variant)
- Blocks: `components/blocks/{block-name}.tsx`

---

## Step 1: Verify prerequisites

Before installing anything, confirm the user's project has:

1. **A `components.json` file** in the project root (shadcn config). If missing, run:
   ```
   npx shadcn@latest init
   ```

2. **The `cn` utility** at `lib/utils.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx"
   import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

   export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
     return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
   }
   ```
   If missing, install dependencies: `npm install clsx tailwind-merge`

3. **A valid license key**. The user must have purchased a React Bits Pro license. Ask the user for their license key if they haven't set it up yet.

---

## Step 2: Configure the license key

The license key must be in a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```
REACTBITS_LICENSE_KEY=<the-users-license-key>
```

**CRITICAL:** Never commit `.env.local` to version control. Ensure `.gitignore` includes it.

---

## Step 3: Configure `components.json`

Add the React Bits Pro registries to the `registries` field in `components.json`. If the `registries` key does not exist, create it.

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@reactbits-starter": {
      "url": "https://pro.reactbits.dev/api/r/starter/{name}.json",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${REACTBITS_LICENSE_KEY}"
      }
    },
    "@reactbits-pro": {
      "url": "https://pro.reactbits.dev/api/r/pro/{name}.json",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${REACTBITS_LICENSE_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Do NOT overwrite** existing `components.json` fields (`$schema`, `style`, `tailwind`, `aliases`, etc.). Only add or merge the `registries` object.

---

## Step 4: Install components

### Installing a component (from @reactbits-starter)

```bash
# Tailwind variant (recommended for Tailwind projects)
npx shadcn@latest add @reactbits-starter/{component-slug}-tw

# CSS variant (for non-Tailwind projects)
npx shadcn@latest add @reactbits-starter/{component-slug}-css
```

### Installing a block (from @reactbits-pro)

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @reactbits-pro/{block-slug}
```

### Installing multiple at once

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @reactbits-starter/silk-waves-tw @reactbits-starter/animated-list-tw @reactbits-pro/hero-1
```

---

## Step 5: Use the installed component

After installation, import and use the component:

```tsx
// Component example
import SilkWaves from "@/components/react-bits/silk-waves";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-full">
      <SilkWaves
        speed={1}
        scale={2}
        colors={["#0d1326", "#162a52", "#1e407e", "#2657aa", "#2e6ed5", "#3785ff", "#5092ff", "#69a0ff"]}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// Block example
import { Hero1 } from "@/components/blocks/hero-1";

export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Hero1 />
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Import patterns

- **Components** use `default` exports: `import ComponentName from "@/components/react-bits/{slug}"`
- **Blocks** use `named` exports matching PascalCase of slug: `import { Hero1 } from "@/components/blocks/hero-1"`
  - The exported function name is the PascalCase version: `hero-1` → `Hero1`, `pricing-3` → `Pricing3`, `navigation-2` → `Navigation2`
- **All components and blocks** include the `"use client"` directive — they are client components

## Common dependency requirements

Many components use specialized libraries. When you install via the shadcn CLI, dependencies are automatically resolved. However, be aware of these key dependencies so you can help the user troubleshoot:

| Dependency | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `three` | Shader, WebGL, 3D components (silk-waves, shader-card, globe, ai-blob, etc.) | Three.js for WebGL rendering |
| `@react-three/fiber` | Some 3D components | React renderer for Three.js |
| `@react-three/drei` | Some 3D components | Helper components for R3F |
| `motion` (or `framer-motion`) | Most animated components and all blocks | Animation library. Import from `motion/react` |
| `gsap` + `@gsap/react` | text-path, 3d-text-reveal, some blocks | GreenSock animation. Requires `ScrollTrigger` plugin for scroll animations |
| `lucide-react` | Most blocks | Icon library |
| `next-themes` | Some components | Theme provider for dark mode |
| `d3` | Some visualization components | Data visualization |

### Important: `"use client"` directive

ALL React Bits Pro components and blocks include `"use client"` at the top. They are client components. If you are using them in a Server Component page in Next.js App Router, simply import them — Next.js handles the client boundary automatically. Do NOT try to remove the `"use client"` directive.

---

## Building a landing page with blocks

A common use case is composing a full landing page from blocks. Here is the recommended approach:

### 1. Install the blocks you need

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @reactbits-pro/navigation-1 @reactbits-pro/hero-1 @reactbits-pro/features-1 @reactbits-pro/social-proof-1 @reactbits-pro/pricing-1 @reactbits-pro/faq-1 @reactbits-pro/cta-1 @reactbits-pro/footer-1
```

### 2. Compose them in a page

```tsx
import { Navigation1 } from "@/components/blocks/navigation-1";
import { Hero1 } from "@/components/blocks/hero-1";
import { Features1 } from "@/components/blocks/features-1";
import { SocialProof1 } from "@/components/blocks/social-proof-1";
import { Pricing1 } from "@/components/blocks/pricing-1";
import { Faq1 } from "@/components/blocks/faq-1";
import { Cta1 } from "@/components/blocks/cta-1";
import { Footer1 } from "@/components/blocks/footer-1";

export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Navigation1 />
      <Hero1 />
      <Features1 />
      <SocialProof1 />
      <Pricing1 />
      <Faq1 />
      <Cta1 />
      <Footer1 />
    </>
  );
}
```

### 3. Customize content

Blocks are installed as local source files. Edit them directly to:
- Replace placeholder text, images, and links with real content
- Adjust colors to match the brand
- Modify layout or spacing
- Add or remove sections within the block
- Wire up form submissions, button clicks, and navigation links

---

## Combining components with blocks

You can use standalone components inside blocks or alongside them:

```tsx
import SilkWaves from "@/components/react-bits/silk-waves";
import { Hero1 } from "@/components/blocks/hero-1";

export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Animated background behind the hero */}
      <div className="relative">
        <div className="absolute inset-0 -z-10">
          <SilkWaves speed={0.5} opacity={0.3} />
        </div>
        <Hero1 />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

---

## Customizing components

Since components are local source files, you can customize them freely:

### Props customization (no code changes needed)

Most components accept extensive props. For example, `SilkWaves`:

```tsx
<SilkWaves
  speed={1.5}
  scale={3}
  distortion={0.8}
  curve={1.2}
  contrast={1}
  colors={["#1a0533", "#2d1b69", "#4a2c8a", "#6b3fa0", "#8b52b8", "#ab65d0", "#cb78e8", "#eb8bff"]}
  rotation={45}
  brightness={1.2}
  opacity={0.9}
  complexity={1.5}
  frequency={1.2}
  className="absolute inset-0"
/>
```

### Source code modification

For deeper changes, edit the installed `.tsx` file directly. Common modifications:
- Changing animation parameters or timing
- Adjusting responsive breakpoints
- Adding new props
- Modifying color schemes
- Integrating with state management
- Connecting to APIs or databases

---

## Dark mode support

All blocks and most components support dark mode via Tailwind's `dark:` variant. They use the standard `dark` class strategy. Ensure your app has a theme provider set up:

```tsx
// layout.tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="system" enableSystem>
          {children}
        </ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Unknown registry @reactbits-starter"
The `registries` block is missing from `components.json`. Add it per Step 3 above.

### "Unauthorized - License key required"
The `REACTBITS_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable is not set. Add it to `.env.local`.

### "Forbidden - Insufficient tier"
The user's license tier doesn't include access to the requested content. Starter licenses cannot access `@reactbits-pro` blocks — a Pro or Ultimate license is required.

### Component not found
- For components: ensure you're using the `-tw` or `-css` suffix (e.g., `silk-waves-tw`, not `silk-waves`)
- For blocks: do NOT add a suffix (e.g., `hero-1`, not `hero-1-tw`)

### Missing `cn` function
Install the utility: `npm install clsx tailwind-merge`, then create `lib/utils.ts` with the `cn` function shown in Step 1.

### WebGL/Three.js components show blank
- Ensure `three` is installed: `npm install three`
- These components require a browser with WebGL support
- The component's container must have explicit dimensions (width/height)
- For SSR frameworks, the `"use client"` directive handles client-only rendering

### GSAP scroll animations not working
- Ensure `gsap` and `@gsap/react` are installed
- `ScrollTrigger` is registered automatically in component code
- The scroll container must be the default document scroll (not a custom scroll container) unless configured

### Blocks look unstyled
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- Blocks use Tailwind v4 syntax — if using v3, minor class adjustments may be needed
- Check that `globals.css` imports Tailwind: `@import "tailwindcss"`

---

## Best practices

1. **Choose one variant and be consistent** — pick either `-tw` or `-css` for all components in a project
2. **Always use the Tailwind variant (`-tw`) if the project uses Tailwind CSS** — it integrates better and is smaller
3. **Give WebGL components explicit dimensions** — wrap them in a container with set width/height
4. **Lazy-load heavy components** — use `next/dynamic` for Three.js-based components if not above the fold:
   ```tsx
   import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
   const SilkWaves = dynamic(() => import("@/components/react-bits/silk-waves"), { ssr: false });
   ```
5. **Keep license keys secure** — never hardcode them; always use environment variables
6. **Customize blocks by editing source** — blocks are meant to be starting points, not rigid templates
7. **Preview before installing** — use `npx shadcn@latest view @reactbits-starter/silk-waves-tw` to inspect a component before adding it
8. **Install this skill into projects** — run `npx shadcn@latest add @reactbits-starter/skill` to drop this SKILL.md into the project root so agents always have it available locally
